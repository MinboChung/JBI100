# Lecture 1

## What is (data) visualziation?
* Complex information $\rightarrow$ Interpretable by humans
  * Techniques involved
* **"The art of making the unseen visible" - Clifford Pickover**
* E.g. SequoiaView
  * Pattern / Structure of the data (Files in tree structure (File system and how they are allocated in the computer))
* E.g. Anscombe's Quartet
  * Identical statistics of the data presented (See lecture slide.)
  * When visualized, they are different data.
  * Number do not tell the whole story

## Why human in the loop?
Interacting datasets designed helps develop tasks effectively.\ 
Not all tasks are suitable for visualization.

## Measurements ... how objective are they?
### Key performance Indixations example: Nail factory
* Optimizing weight
  * Resulted to create **Heavy nails**
* Optimize amount
  * **Lot of nails but smaller in size** 
### Goodharts Law
* Quantitative Vs Qualitative measure of success.
When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

## Data Visualization
Making pretty pictures? No! \
Making complex data visible and interpretable\
Gaining insight \
Visualization as such is rather old ... (Older concept than Computer visualization) \
E.g. Cholera Map London J. Snow, 1854

## What is data visualization?
Sankey Diagram (Inspired by the military troop of Napoleon data visualization)
- Data in ever increasing sizes, graphical approach necessary
- **Infographics** and business graphics (Excel, etc.)

## Showing the data has an impact
Gun ownership (Publicly visible) in New York.

### What impact?
Of understanding the data

### **Three types of goals** 

**Important for the project**

Visualization, ...
* ... to explore: Nothing is known \
    **Vis.** used **for** **Data Exploration**
    - Try to understand data and formulate hypothesis
* ... to analyze
    There are hypotheses,\
    **Vis.** used **Verification or Falsification**
    Medical imaging perspective.

* ... to present
    "Everything" known **about the data**,\
    **Vis.** used for **Communication** of results

### Presentation vs Exploration
Infographics
- Interactive
- Explorative
- Domain expert (E.g. Scientist)

## Data Visualzation - Multidisciplinary
Simplify\
Numerical analysis\
ML
image processing\
Algorithmics\
Optimization\
Application domain\
computer graphics\
Infographics\
etc.\
- This course covers parts of it.

## Visualization field: InfoVis vs SciVis
- InfoVis
- SciVis
  - Spatial data
    - Simulation
    - MedVis
    - VolVis
    - FlowVis

## Interaction Factors matter for visualization.

U.S. election decision tree for example

## Visualization Design
- Huge space of design alternatives
  - Tradeoffs abound
- Many possibilities now known to be ineffective
  - Avoid random walk through the possibilities avoid some known mistakes
  - Extensive experimentation has already been done
- Guidelines continue to evolve

## Visualization Design Process
* See Lecture slide.

## Validation is difficult
* How do you know if the vis design works?
  * Better?
  * Faster?
  * More effectively?
  * Get more insight?
* Difficult to define good visualization
* Exploratory goal is difficult
* What sort of tasks do you need to evaluate a system?
  * Intended users?
  * Benchmark datasets?

## Visualization Design (Nested model)
Way to approach in structure way to evaulate the design. See slide.
