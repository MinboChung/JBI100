## Requirements for the final project?

| Criteria | Ratings | Pts |
|----|----|----|
| Introduction and problem description | <ul> <li>There is a clear problem and a well-defined goal</li> <li>There is a clear need for visualization to solve this problem.</li><li>The problem is complex and requires at least multiple views on several aspects of the data</li><li>The problem is novel and there exist no visualization solutions for it.</li></ul>| 40  |
| Data analysis and abstraction (What) | <ul><li>The data analysis covers all the relevant aspects of the data and its importance for the chosen domain/goal.</li><li>There has been an effort in data processing, parsing and deriving new data.</li> <li>A complete data abstraction with desciprtion of the main characteristics including the attributes and their types is provided</li></ul> | 40  |
| Task analysis | <ul><li>The task analysis relates to the overall goal.</li> <li>It is extensive, detailed and considers multiple perspectives and task types.</li><li>It develops from high (e.g. generate hypothesis) to low level tasks (e.g. compare items).</li> <li>The task analysis covers the full potential of the data w.r.t. the information that could be obtained from it.</li></ul> | 80  |
| Task abstraction | <ul><li>The abstraction is derived from the task analysis</li><li>It is well done.</li></ul> | 40  |
|Visualization and Interaction Design (How)| <ul><li>A thorough evaluation of possible techniques is given</li> <li>The design choices (i.e. idioms, visual encodings, interaction) for specific techniques are well motivated based on the theory</li> <li>Principles presented in class and derived from the tasks and data extraction</li></ul> | 170  |
|Visualization and Interaction (Realization)| <ul><li>A sleek application has been implemented.</li> <li>A variety of visual encodings and interactions are implemented which are adequatem work smoothly and match the design.</li> <li>Interaction plays an important role.</li><li>The linked views are between the idioms and go beyond filtering and selection based on GUI widgets.</li> <li>The linkage among views is multidirectional.</li><li>There is a level of complexity in the generated implementation and linkage.</li></ul> | 90  |
|Multivariate visualization (Realization)| <ul><li>Advanced idioms that visualize Multivariate/High-dimensional relations are included (e.g. PCPs, SPLOMs, Graph visualizations, ...).</li> <li>They are used adequately and well embedded in the overall design.</li> <li>Optionally new visualizations are proposed, that advance and suit the goals and tasks.</li> <li>Non-trivial visualizations have been implemented.</li><li>There is level of complexity in the generated implementation.</li></ul> | 90  |
|Use Case| <ul><li>Extensive data exploration process.</li> <li>Analysis covers defined tasks/questions.</li> <li>Excellent illustration of results.</li> <li>Many results are obtained by interaction.</li> <li>The screencast provides an excellent combination of demonstration of interactive features and highlights how these were used to obtain the results</li></ul| 90  |
|Conclusion and Future work| <ul><li>Results are discussed in detail.</li> <li>Discussion of benefits and disadvantages of techniques for analysis process.</li> <li>Shortcomings of initial choices are discussed.</li></ul> | 40  |
|Report|<ul><li>Report should be used as a model of how to fulfil the assignment.</li><li> The code is well document and commented.</li></ul>| 90  |
|Screencast Content and Structure, Presentation, Form and Clarity| <ul><li>The screencast is done with a lot of care, and have a high quality.</li><li> All or most aspects are excellent.</li></ul> | 80  |
